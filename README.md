## Summary

Personal website using Gatsby! Styled using `styled-components`.

### Run it Locally

> Note: You'll need Node and Gatsby CLI. Gatsby's got a great [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) to help setup both!

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. In terminal, go to the directory containing the cloned repo.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   # npm
   npm install

   # yarn
   yarn
   ```

4. Get it a server going by running `gatsby develop`, and in your favourite browser, find it on `localhost:8000`!

### Why Gatsby?

I wanted to try out creating a static site. Since I was already familiar with React, I decided to try out Gatsby!
